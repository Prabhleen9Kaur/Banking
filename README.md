This project is to manage portfolio analysis.

<h4>Project Functionalities:</h4>

* Sigin/Signup:
User should be able to signup/sigin using UserName, Password, email.
That information should be retained and everytime the user logs in they should be able to have access to the same portfolio they created.

* Portfolio Analysis:
Users should be able to create and edit their portfolios using a search box through symbol or stock name query. There should be an extensive stock database containing all currently traded NYSE or more stocks.

* Stock Information Display:
When a user clicks on a stock, for example AAPL, the stock's candlestick chart, statistics, fundamentals, predictions, should be displayed. Users should be able to zoom in on the graph, mouse over for more daily information, and draw trendlines with percentage displays. The current traded price, volumes traded, volatility, and fundamentals of the company will be displayed below the graph, and a user can click to see more details. News articles or twitter feeds regarding the stock will be displayed on the right, along with a sentamental analysis of social media feeds.

This is still some modifications.
